        Using the code above, I made a navigation bar. 
        This navigation bar is a simple table, with clickable links inside the cells for the various pages shown on the page. 
        For example, the &quot;About Me&quot; cell on the navigation bar will take you to the <a href="index.html">About Me</a> page. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the navigation bar, I also made the About Me page that was mentioned earlier. 
        One half of the About Me page is a div with my picture and a short biography of me next to each other. 
        The image and the text are together because of this code:
    </p>
    <img src="checkpoint/images/boxCode.png">
    <p>
        The div has the id #firstbox.
        Using the universal selector *,
        this id will have the image and the text in the same line.
        Without this code, the text would be underneath the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition the the above div, I also made three separate lists of some of my favorite things.
        The list items all have a favorite thing of mine next to a picture of it.
        These lists are all divs inside of a larger div.
        Connecting the three divs was similar to putting my image and my short biography next to each other.
        In a large div holding all the elements that I want next to each other, 
        I used the "display:inline-block;" with the universal selector * like before.
        I also wanted to make the pictures in the list links to the Wikipedia articles of the thing it was describing.
        To do this I used this code:
    </p>
    <img src="checkpoint/images/link-image.png">
    <p>
        (The above picture is actually outdated, the picture is 50 by 50 now)
    </p>
    <p>
        By wrapping the anchor tag outside of the image,
        I was able to make the image link to that specific Wikipedia article.
        The code "target="_blank"" was added so that I could open the link in a new tab. 
        I was also able to resize the image to 50 by 50 using the height and width attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        An important choice that I made was to make the background a gif.
        I did this using the following code:
    </p>
    <img src="checkpoint/images/backgroundCode.png">
    <p>
        The selector "background-image" selects the background image, and the url selects the gif with that url.
        In this case, the url was a .gif file within the /images/ folder.
        I got the gif file from <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/stars-night-sky-twinkling-FlodpfQUBSp20" target="_blank">this website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another choice I made was to have the images in the list aligned vertically.
        I did this by gradually increasing the size of the text until the image would wrap onto the next page.
        After that, I would use the last font size that still has the image still inline with it.
        After changing the sizes of all text, I would adjust the margin-top of all three lists to touch the div with my picture and my short biography on it.
